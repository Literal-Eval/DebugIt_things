# DebugIt_things
My set of codes written for the Debug It competition.

# What is it?
Tic Tac Toe is a solved game, meaning that its every game will end up in a draw if both sides play fairly.
A side wins only if the other side makes a mistake.
The objective is to create a solid 3, horizontally, vertically, or either of the diagonally.

# About this project
This version of Tic Tac Toe is implemented in Python, using PyGame as its display library. 

  #### Dependency
  pygame module.
  Can be installed by following command.
  
  > pip install pygame
  
  Make sure Calibri font is installed in your PC. It's default in Windows.
    
# How to
Just run the T3A.py file after installing pygame.
# Some fun
There is an intentional bug in this piece of code, which lets you win against CPU if you go through that specific sequence. 
Try to find that sequence.
Other than that specific bug, you'll never win.
